## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#003049) to convey a professional and sophisticated look.
- Background color: Even darker blue (#001C30) for a deep and modern dark theme.
- Accent color: Cyan (#40E0D0) for interactive elements and highlights, providing a vibrant contrast against the dark background.
- Headline font: 'Roboto', sans-serif, for a clean and professional look. Suitable for headings and calls to action.
- Body font: 'Open Sans', sans-serif, for readability in longer text sections.
- Use sleek, modern icons with a glowing effect to match the dark theme. Icons should be related to birthdays (balloons, cakes, presents).
- Clean and minimalist layout, focusing on ease of use and visual hierarchy. Use subtle shadows and gradients to add depth.
- Subtle, glowing animations to indicate Alpha's special day is approaching. Consider a slowly pulsating countdown timer or gently floating celebratory graphics.
